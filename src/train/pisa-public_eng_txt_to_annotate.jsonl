Creativity is admirable but people should find ways to express themselves that do not inflict extra costs upon society.\n\nWhy do you spoil the reputation of young people by painting graffiti where it’s forbidden? Professional artists do not hang their paintings in the streets, do they? Instead they seek funding and gain fame through legal exhibitions.\n\nIn my opinion buildings, fences and park benches are works of art in themselves. It’s really pathetic to spoil this architecture with graffiti and what’s more, the method destroys the ozone layer. Really, I can’t understand why these criminal artists bother as their “artistic works” are just removed from sight over and over again.\n    Helga\n\nThere is no accounting for taste. Society is full of communication and advertising. Company logos, shop names. Large intrusive posters on the streets. Are they acceptable? Yes, mostly. Is graffiti acceptable? Some people say yes, some no.\n\nWho pays the price for graffiti? Who is ultimately paying the price for advertisements? Correct. The consumer.\n\nHave the people who put up billboards asked your permission? No. Should graffiti painters do so then? Isn’t it all just a question of communication – your own name, the names of gangs and large works of art in the street?\n\nThink about the striped and chequered clothes that appeared in the stores a few years ago. And ski wear. The patterns and colours were stolen directly from the flowery concrete walls. It’s quite amusing that these patterns and colours are accepted and admired but that graffiti in the same style is considered dreadful.\n\nTimes are hard for art.\n    Sophia\n\nSource: Mari Hankala.\n\nThe two letters above come from the Internet and are about graffiti.

She could just faintly remember the beginning of the rain,\n    driving in across the swamp from the south and beating against the shell of her house.\n    Then the river itself started rising, slowly at first until at last it paused to turn back. From\n 5  hour to hour it slithered up creeks and ditches and poured over low places. In the night,\n    while she slept, it claimed the road and surrounded her so that she sat alone, her boat\n    gone, the house like a piece of drift lodged on its bluff. Now even against the tarred\n    planks of the supports the waters touched. And still they rose.\n\n\n    As far as she could see, to the treetops where the opposite banks had been, the swamp\n10  was an empty sea, awash with sheets of rain, the river lost somewhere in its vastness.\n    Her house with its boat bottom had been built to ride just such a flood, if one ever\n    came, but now it was old. Maybe the boards underneath were partly rotted away.\n    Maybe the cable mooring the house to the great live oak would snap loose and let her\n    go turning downstream, the way her boat had gone.\n\n15  No one could come now. She could cry out but it would be no use, no one would\n    hear. Down the length and breadth of the swamp others were fighting to save what\n    little they could, maybe even their lives. She had seen a whole house go floating by,\n    so quiet she was reminded of sitting at a funeral. She thought when she saw it she\n    knew whose house it was. It had been bad seeing it drift by, but the owners must\n20  have escaped to higher ground. Later, with the rain and darkness pressing in, she had\n    heard a panther scream upriver.\n\n    Now the house seemed to shudder around her like something alive. She reached\n    out to catch a lamp as it tilted off the table by her bed and put it between her feet to\n    hold it steady. Then creaking and groaning with effort the house struggled up from the\n25  clay, floated free, bobbing like a cork and swung out slowly with the pull of the river.\n    She gripped the edge of the bed. Swaying from side to side, the house moved to the\n    length of its mooring. There was a jolt and a complaining of old timbers and then a\n    pause. Slowly the current released it and let it swing back, rasping across its resting\n    place. She caught her breath and sat for a long time feeling the slow pendulous\n30  sweeps. The dark sifted down through the incessant rain, and, head on arm, she slept\n    holding on to the bed.\n\n    Sometime in the night the cry awoke her, a sound so anguished she was on her feet\n    before she was awake. In the dark she stumbled against the bed. It came from out\n    there, from the river. She could hear something moving, something large that made\n35  a dredging, sweeping sound. It could be another house. Then it hit, not head on but\n    glancing and sliding down the length of her house. It was a tree. She listened as the\n    branches and leaves cleared themselves and went on downstream, leaving only the\n    rain and the lappings of the flood, sounds so constant now that they seemed a part of the silence. Huddled on the bed, she was almost asleep again when another cry\n40  sounded, this time so close it could have been in the room. Staring into the dark,\n    she eased back on the bed until her hand caught the cold shape of the rifle. Then\n    crouched on the pillow, she cradled the gun across her knees. “Who’s there?” she\n    called.\n\n    The answer was a repeated cry, but less shrill, tired sounding, then the empty silence\n45  closing in. She drew back against the bed. Whatever was there she could hear it\n    moving about on the porch. Planks creaked and she could distinguish the sounds of\n    objects being knocked over. There was a scratching on the wall as if it would tear its\n    way in. She knew now what it was, a big cat, deposited by the uprooted tree that had\n    passed her. It had come with the flood, a gift.\n\n50  Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened throat.\n    The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She had\n    heard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance.\n    The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long as\n    she guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged,\n55  she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws across the rusted\n    outer screen. Now and then, it whined and growled.\n\n    When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of\n    dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on the\n    river, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself to\n60  move for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with the\n    movement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the grey\n    light, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape of\n    drowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying the\n    gun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It was\n65  still there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the mooring\n    of her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It did\n    not seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs,\n    its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its long\n    tail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turned\n70  around. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window,\n    shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, she\n    fired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. It\n    began to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passed\n    the window.\n\n75  Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of the\n    river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched the\n    window and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look.\n    The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first time\n    since the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything \n80  in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her shoulders. She\n    should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before her\n    boat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house a\n    deep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn’t eaten. She couldn’t remember for\n    how long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire with\n85  the few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have to burn the chair,\n    maybe even the table itself. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from the\n    ceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. The\n    smell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last time\n    she had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water.\n\n90  While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It\n    was hungry too. “Let me eat,” she called to it, “and then I’ll see to you.” And she\n    laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the cat\n    growled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake.\n\n95  After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house had\n    risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from the\n    river. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung in\n    the rain. She crept slowly to the window. It was still there, mewling, beginning to\n    move about the porch. She stared at it a long time, unafraid. Then without thinking\n100 what she was doing, she laid the gun aside and started around the edge of the bed\n    to the kitchen. Behind her the cat was moving, fretting. She took down what was\n    left of the ham and making her way back across the swaying floor to the window\n    she shoved it through the broken pane. On the other side there was a hungry snarl\n    and something like a shock passed from the animal to her. Stunned by what she had\n105 done, she drew back to the bed. She could hear the sounds of the panther tearing at\n    the meat. The house rocked around her.\n\n    The next time she awoke she knew at once that everything had changed. The rain had\n    stopped. She felt for the movement of the house but it no longer swayed on the flood.\n    Drawing her door open, she saw through the torn screen a different world. The house\n110 was resting on the bluff where it always had. A few feet down, the river still raced on\n    in a torrent, but it no longer covered the few feet between the house and the live oak.\n    And the cat was gone. Leading from the porch to the live oak and doubtless on into\n    the swamp were tracks, indistinct and already disappearing into the soft mud. And\n    there on the porch, gnawed to whiteness, was what was left of the ham.\n\nSource: Dollarhide, Louis, “The Gift”, in Mississippi Writers: Reflections of Childhood and Youth, Volume 1, edited by Dorothy Abbott, University Press of Mississippi, 1985.\n\nUse the story “The Gift” on the previous three pages to answer the questions which follow.

She could just faintly remember the beginning of the rain,\n    driving in across the swamp from the south and beating against the shell of her house.\n    Then the river itself started rising, slowly at first until at last it paused to turn back. From\n 5  hour to hour it slithered up creeks and ditches and poured over low places. In the night,\n    while she slept, it claimed the road and surrounded her so that she sat alone, her boat\n    gone, the house like a piece of drift lodged on its bluff. Now even against the tarred\n    planks of the supports the waters touched. And still they rose.\n\n\n    As far as she could see, to the treetops where the opposite banks had been, the swamp\n10  was an empty sea, awash with sheets of rain, the river lost somewhere in its vastness.\n    Her house with its boat bottom had been built to ride just such a flood, if one ever\n    came, but now it was old. Maybe the boards underneath were partly rotted away.\n    Maybe the cable mooring the house to the great live oak would snap loose and let her\n    go turning downstream, the way her boat had gone.\n\n15  No one could come now. She could cry out but it would be no use, no one would\n    hear. Down the length and breadth of the swamp others were fighting to save what\n    little they could, maybe even their lives. She had seen a whole house go floating by,\n    so quiet she was reminded of sitting at a funeral. She thought when she saw it she\n    knew whose house it was. It had been bad seeing it drift by, but the owners must\n20  have escaped to higher ground. Later, with the rain and darkness pressing in, she had\n    heard a panther scream upriver.\n\n    Now the house seemed to shudder around her like something alive. She reached\n    out to catch a lamp as it tilted off the table by her bed and put it between her feet to\n    hold it steady. Then creaking and groaning with effort the house struggled up from the\n25  clay, floated free, bobbing like a cork and swung out slowly with the pull of the river.\n    She gripped the edge of the bed. Swaying from side to side, the house moved to the\n    length of its mooring. There was a jolt and a complaining of old timbers and then a\n    pause. Slowly the current released it and let it swing back, rasping across its resting\n    place. She caught her breath and sat for a long time feeling the slow pendulous\n30  sweeps. The dark sifted down through the incessant rain, and, head on arm, she slept\n    holding on to the bed.\n\n    Sometime in the night the cry awoke her, a sound so anguished she was on her feet\n    before she was awake. In the dark she stumbled against the bed. It came from out\n    there, from the river. She could hear something moving, something large that made\n35  a dredging, sweeping sound. It could be another house. Then it hit, not head on but\n    glancing and sliding down the length of her house. It was a tree. She listened as the\n    branches and leaves cleared themselves and went on downstream, leaving only the\n    rain and the lappings of the flood, sounds so constant now that they seemed a part of the silence. Huddled on the bed, she was almost asleep again when another cry\n40  sounded, this time so close it could have been in the room. Staring into the dark,\n    she eased back on the bed until her hand caught the cold shape of the rifle. Then\n    crouched on the pillow, she cradled the gun across her knees. “Who’s there?” she\n    called.\n\n    The answer was a repeated cry, but less shrill, tired sounding, then the empty silence\n45  closing in. She drew back against the bed. Whatever was there she could hear it\n    moving about on the porch. Planks creaked and she could distinguish the sounds of\n    objects being knocked over. There was a scratching on the wall as if it would tear its\n    way in. She knew now what it was, a big cat, deposited by the uprooted tree that had\n    passed her. It had come with the flood, a gift.\n\n50  Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened throat.\n    The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She had\n    heard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance.\n    The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long as\n    she guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged,\n55  she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws across the rusted\n    outer screen. Now and then, it whined and growled.\n\n    When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of\n    dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on the\n    river, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself to\n60  move for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with the\n    movement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the grey\n    light, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape of\n    drowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying the\n    gun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It was\n65  still there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the mooring\n    of her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It did\n    not seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs,\n    its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its long\n    tail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turned\n70  around. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window,\n    shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, she\n    fired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. It\n    began to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passed\n    the window.\n\n75  Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of the\n    river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched the\n    window and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look.\n    The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first time\n    since the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything \n80  in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her shoulders. She\n    should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before her\n    boat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house a\n    deep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn’t eaten. She couldn’t remember for\n    how long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire with\n85  the few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have to burn the chair,\n    maybe even the table itself. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from the\n    ceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. The\n    smell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last time\n    she had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water.\n\n90  While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It\n    was hungry too. “Let me eat,” she called to it, “and then I’ll see to you.” And she\n    laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the cat\n    growled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake.\n\n95  After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house had\n    risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from the\n    river. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung in\n    the rain. She crept slowly to the window. It was still there, mewling, beginning to\n    move about the porch.

She could cry out but it would be no use, no one would\n    hear. Down the length and breadth of the swamp others were fighting to save what\n    little they could, maybe even their lives. She had seen a whole house go floating by,\n    so quiet she was reminded of sitting at a funeral. She thought when she saw it she\n    knew whose house it was. It had been bad seeing it drift by, but the owners must\n20  have escaped to higher ground. Later, with the rain and darkness pressing in, she had\n    heard a panther scream upriver.\n\n    Now the house seemed to shudder around her like something alive. She reached\n    out to catch a lamp as it tilted off the table by her bed and put it between her feet to\n    hold it steady. Then creaking and groaning with effort the house struggled up from the\n25  clay, floated free, bobbing like a cork and swung out slowly with the pull of the river.\n    She gripped the edge of the bed. Swaying from side to side, the house moved to the\n    length of its mooring. There was a jolt and a complaining of old timbers and then a\n    pause. Slowly the current released it and let it swing back, rasping across its resting\n    place. She caught her breath and sat for a long time feeling the slow pendulous\n30  sweeps. The dark sifted down through the incessant rain, and, head on arm, she slept\n    holding on to the bed.\n\n    Sometime in the night the cry awoke her, a sound so anguished she was on her feet\n    before she was awake. In the dark she stumbled against the bed. It came from out\n    there, from the river. She could hear something moving, something large that made\n35  a dredging, sweeping sound. It could be another house. Then it hit, not head on but\n    glancing and sliding down the length of her house. It was a tree. She listened as the\n    branches and leaves cleared themselves and went on downstream, leaving only the\n    rain and the lappings of the flood, sounds so constant now that they seemed a part of the silence. Huddled on the bed, she was almost asleep again when another cry\n40  sounded, this time so close it could have been in the room. Staring into the dark,\n    she eased back on the bed until her hand caught the cold shape of the rifle. Then\n    crouched on the pillow, she cradled the gun across her knees. “Who’s there?” she\n    called.\n\n    The answer was a repeated cry, but less shrill, tired sounding, then the empty silence\n45  closing in. She drew back against the bed. Whatever was there she could hear it\n    moving about on the porch. Planks creaked and she could distinguish the sounds of\n    objects being knocked over. There was a scratching on the wall as if it would tear its\n    way in. She knew now what it was, a big cat, deposited by the uprooted tree that had\n    passed her. It had come with the flood, a gift.\n\n50  Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened throat.\n    The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She had\n    heard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance.\n    The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long as\n    she guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged,\n55  she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws across the rusted\n    outer screen. Now and then, it whined and growled.\n\n    When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of\n    dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on the\n    river, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself to\n60  move for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with the\n    movement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the grey\n    light, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape of\n    drowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying the\n    gun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It was\n65  still there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the mooring\n    of her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It did\n    not seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs,\n    its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its long\n    tail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turned\n70  around. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window,\n    shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, she\n    fired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. It\n    began to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passed\n    the window.\n\n75  Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of the\n    river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched the\n    window and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look.\n    The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first time\n    since the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything \n80  in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her shoulders. She\n    should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before her\n    boat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house a\n    deep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn’t eaten. She couldn’t remember for\n    how long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire with\n85  the few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have to burn the chair,\n    maybe even the table itself. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from the\n    ceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. The\n    smell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last time\n    she had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water.\n\n90  While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It\n    was hungry too. “Let me eat,” she called to it, “and then I’ll see to you.” And she\n    laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the cat\n    growled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake.\n\n95  After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house had\n    risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from the\n    river. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung in\n    the rain. She crept slowly to the window. It was still there, mewling, beginning to\n    move about the porch. She stared at it a long time, unafraid. Then without thinking\n100 what she was doing, she laid the gun aside and started around the edge of the bed\n    to the kitchen. Behind her the cat was moving, fretting. She took down what was\n    left of the ham and making her way back across the swaying floor to the window\n    she shoved it through the broken pane. On the other side there was a hungry snarl\n    and something like a shock passed from the animal to her. Stunned by what she had\n105 done, she drew back to the bed. She could hear the sounds of the panther tearing at\n    the meat. The house rocked around her.\n\n    The next time she awoke she knew at once that everything had changed. The rain had\n    stopped. She felt for the movement of the house but it no longer swayed on the flood.\n    Drawing her door open, she saw through the torn screen a different world. The house\n110 was resting on the bluff where it always had. A few feet down, the river still raced on\n    in a torrent, but it no longer covered the few feet between the house and the live oak.\n    And the cat was gone. Leading from the porch to the live oak and doubtless on into\n    the swamp were tracks, indistinct and already disappearing into the soft mud. And\n    there on the porch, gnawed to whiteness, was what was left of the ham.\n\nSource: Dollarhide, Louis, “The Gift”, in Mississippi Writers: Reflections of Childhood and Youth, Volume 1, edited by Dorothy Abbott, University Press of Mississippi, 1985.\n\nUse the story “The Gift” on the previous three pages to answer the questions which follow.

It had come with the flood, a gift.\n\n50  Unconsciously she pressed her hand against her face and along her tightened throat.\n    The rifle rocked across her knees. She had never seen a panther in her life. She had\n    heard about them from others and heard their cries, like suffering, in the distance.\n    The cat was scratching on the wall again, rattling the window by the door. As long as\n    she guarded the window and kept the cat hemmed in by the wall and water, caged,\n55  she would be all right. Outside, the animal paused to rake his claws across the rusted\n    outer screen. Now and then, it whined and growled.\n\n    When the light filtered down through the rain at last, coming like another kind of\n    dark, she was still sitting on the bed, stiff and cold. Her arms, used to rowing on the\n    river, ached from the stillness of holding the rifle. She had hardly allowed herself to\n60  move for fear any sound might give strength to the cat. Rigid, she swayed with the\n    movement of the house. The rain still fell as if it would never stop. Through the grey\n    light, finally, she could see the rain-pitted flood and far away the cloudy shape of\n    drowned treetops. The cat was not moving now. Maybe he had gone away. Laying the\n    gun aside she slipped off the bed and moved without a sound to the window. It was\n65  still there, crouched at the edge of the porch, staring up at the live oak, the mooring\n    of her house, as if gauging its chances of leaping to an overhanging branch. It did\n    not seem so frightening now that she could see it, its coarse fur napped into twigs,\n    its sides pinched and ribs showing. It would be easy to shoot it where it sat, its long\n    tail whipping back and forth. She was moving back to get the gun when it turned\n70  around. With no warning, no crouch or tensing of muscles, it sprang at the window,\n    shattering a pane of glass. She fell back, stifling a scream, and taking up the rifle, she\n    fired through the window. She could not see the panther now, but she had missed. It\n    began to pace again. She could glimpse its head and the arch of its back as it passed\n    the window.\n\n75  Shivering, she pulled back on the bed and lay down. The lulling constant sound of the\n    river and the rain, the penetrating chill, drained away her purpose. She watched the\n    window and kept the gun ready. After waiting a long while she moved again to look.\n    The panther had fallen asleep, its head on its paws, like a housecat. For the first time\n    since the rains began she wanted to cry, for herself, for all the people, for everything \n80  in the flood. Sliding down on the bed, she pulled the quilt around her shoulders. She\n    should have got out when she could, while the roads were still open or before her\n    boat was washed away. As she rocked back and forth with the sway of the house a\n    deep ache in her stomach reminded her she hadn’t eaten. She couldn’t remember for\n    how long. Like the cat, she was starving. Easing into the kitchen, she made a fire with\n85  the few remaining sticks of wood. If the flood lasted she would have to burn the chair,\n    maybe even the table itself. Taking down the remains of a smoked ham from the\n    ceiling, she cut thick slices of the brownish red meat and placed them in a skillet. The\n    smell of the frying meat made her dizzy. There were stale biscuits from the last time\n    she had cooked and she could make some coffee. There was plenty of water.\n\n90  While she was cooking her food, she almost forgot about the cat until it whined. It\n    was hungry too. “Let me eat,” she called to it, “and then I’ll see to you.” And she\n    laughed under her breath. As she hung the rest of the ham back on its nail the cat\n    growled a deep throaty rumble that made her hand shake.\n\n95  After she had eaten, she went to the bed again and took up the rifle. The house had\n    risen so high now it no longer scraped across the bluff when it swung back from the\n    river. The food had warmed her. She could get rid of the cat while light still hung in\n    the rain. She crept slowly to the window. It was still there, mewling, beginning to\n    move about the porch. She stared at it a long time, unafraid. Then without thinking\n100 what she was doing, she laid the gun aside and started around the edge of the bed\n    to the kitchen. Behind her the cat was moving, fretting. She took down what was\n    left of the ham and making her way back across the swaying floor to the window\n    she shoved it through the broken pane. On the other side there was a hungry snarl\n    and something like a shock passed from the animal to her. Stunned by what she had\n105 done, she drew back to the bed. She could hear the sounds of the panther tearing at\n    the meat. The house rocked around her.\n\n    The next time she awoke she knew at once that everything had changed. The rain had\n    stopped. She felt for the movement of the house but it no longer swayed on the flood.\n    Drawing her door open, she saw through the torn screen a different world. The house\n110 was resting on the bluff where it always had. A few feet down, the river still raced on\n    in a torrent, but it no longer covered the few feet between the house and the live oak.\n    And the cat was gone. Leading from the porch to the live oak and doubtless on into\n    the swamp were tracks, indistinct and already disappearing into the soft mud. And\n    there on the porch, gnawed to whiteness, was what was left of the ham.\n\nSource: Dollarhide, Louis, “The Gift”, in Mississippi Writers: Reflections of Childhood and Youth, Volume 1, edited by Dorothy Abbott, University Press of Mississippi, 1985.\n\nUse the story “The Gift” on the previous three pages to answer the questions which follow.

At a shop called Réséda Soeurs, the Duchess, who is the Prince’s aunt, has met a young shop assistant, Amanda, who looks amazingly like Léocadia. The Duchess wants Amanda to help her set the Prince free from the memories which haunt him.\n\nA crossroads in the castle grounds, a circular bench\naround a small obelisk...evening is falling...\n\n    AMANDA\nI still don’t understand. What can I do for him, ma’am? I can’t believe you could possibly have thought...And why me? I’m not particularly pretty. And even if someone were very pretty—who could suddenly come between him and his memories like that?\n\n    THE DUCHESS\nNo-one but you.\n\n    AMANDA, sincerely surprised\nMe?\n\n    THE DUCHESS\nThe world is so foolish, my child. It sees only parades, gestures, badges of office...that must be why you have never been told. But my heart hasn’t deceived me—I almost cried out at Réséda Soeurs the first time I saw you. To someone who knew more of her than just her public image, you are the\nliving likeness of Léocadia.\n\nA silence. The evening birds have now taken over from the\nafternoon birds. The grounds are filled with shadows and\ntwittering.\n\n    AMANDA, very gently\nI really don’t think I can, ma’am. I have nothing, I\nam nothing, and those lovers...that was my fancy,\ndon’t you see?\n\nShe has got up. As if about to leave, she has picked up her\nsmall suitcase.\n\n    THE DUCHESS, gently also, and very wearily\nOf course, my dear. I apologise.\n\nShe in turn gets up, with difficulty, like an old woman. A\nbicycle bell is heard in the evening air; she gives a start.\n\nListen...it’s him! Just show yourself to him, leaning against this little obelisk where he first met her. Let him see you, even if it’s just this once, let him call out, take a sudden interest in this likeness, in this stratagem which I shall confess to him tomorrow and for which he will hate me—in anything but this dead girl who’ll take him away from me one of these days, I’m sure...(She has taken her by the arm.) You will do that, won’t you? I beg you most humbly, young lady. (She looks at her, beseechingly, and quickly adds:) And then, that way, you’ll see him too. And...I can feel that I’m blushing again from saying this to you—life is just too mad! That’s the third time I’ve blushed in sixty years, and the second time in ten minutes—you’ll see him; and if he could ever (why not him, since he’s handsome and charming and he wouldn’t be the first?) if he could ever have the good fortune, for himself and for me, to take your fancy for one moment...The bell again in the shadows, but very close now.\n\n    AMANDA, in a whisper\nWhat should I say to him?\n\n    THE DUCHESS, gripping her arm\nSimply say: “Excuse me, Sir, can you tell me the way to the sea?”\n\nShe has hurried into the deeper shadows of the trees. Just in time. There is a pale blur. It is the Prince on his bicycle. He passes very close to the pale lur of Amanda by the obelisk. She murmurs.\n\n    AMANDA\nExcuse me, Sir...\n\nHe stops, dismounts from the bicycle, takes off his hat and\nlooks at her.\n\n    THE PRINCE\nYes?\n\n    AMANDA\nCan you tell me the way to the sea?\n\n    THE PRINCE\nTake the second turning on your left.\n\nHe bows, sadly and courteously, gets back on the bicycle and rides away. The bell is heard again in the distance. The Duchess comes out of the shadows, very much an old\nwoman.\n\n    AMANDA, gently, after a while\nHe didn’t recognise me...\n\n    THE DUCHESS\nIt was dark...And then, who knows what face he gives her now, in his dreams? (She asks timidly:)\n\nThe last train has gone, young lady. In any case,wouldn’t you like to stay at the castle tonight?\n\n    AMANDA, in a strange voice\nYes, ma’am.\n\nIt is completely dark. The two of them can no longer be seen in the shadows, and only the wind can be heard in the huge trees of the grounds.\n\n    THE CURTAIN FALLS\n\n\nSource: Jean Anouilh, Léocadia (end of Scene II).

He not only positions the actors, arranges their entrances and exits and directs their acting, but also suggests how the script is to be interpreted.\n\nWardrobe staff: produce the costumes from a model.\n\nSet designer: designs models of the sets and costumes. These models are then transformed into their full size in the workshop.\n\nProps manager: in charge of finding the required props. The word “props” is used to mean everything that can be moved: armchairs, letters, lamps, bunches of flowers, etc. The sets and costumes are not props.\n\nSound technician: in charge of all sound effects required for the production. He is at the controls during the show.\n\nLighting assistant or lighting technician: in charge of lighting. He is also at the controls during the show.

Next week I will take up a position as “Herr Doktor” at the First Ward of the maternity clinic of the Vienna General Hospital. I was frightened when I heard about the percentage of patients who die in this clinic. This month not less than 36 of the 208 mothers died there, all from puerperal fever. Giving birth to a child is as dangerous as first-degree pneumonia.’\n\nThese lines from the diary of Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-1865) illustrate the devastating effects of puerperal fever, a contagious disease that killed many woman after childbirth.

Why do so many women die from this fever after giving birth without any problems? For centuries science has told us that it is an invisible epidemic that kills mothers. Causes may be changes in the air or some extraterrestrial influence or a movement of the earth itself, an earthquake.’\n\nNowadays not many people would consider extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake as possible causes of fever. We now know it has to do with hygienic conditions. But in the time Semmelweis lived, many people, even scientists, did! However, Semmelweis knew that it was unlikely that fever could be caused by extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake. He pointed at the data he collected (see diagram) and used this to try to persuade his colleagues.\n\n# Semmelweis’ Diary Text 2\n\nPart of the research in the hospital was dissection. The body of a deceased person was cut open to find a cause of death. Semmelweis recorded that the students working on the First ward usually took part in dissections on women who died the previous day, before they examined women who had just given birth. They did not pay much attention to cleaning themselves after the dissections. Some were even proud of the fact that you could tell by their smell that they had been working in the mortuary, as this showed how industrious they were!

Next week I will take up a position as “Herr Doktor” at the First Ward of the maternity clinic of the Vienna General Hospital. I was frightened when I heard about the percentage of patients who die in this clinic. This month not less than 36 of the 208 mothers died there, all from puerperal fever. Giving birth to a child is as dangerous as first-degree pneumonia.’\n\nThese lines from the diary of Ignaz Semmelweis (1818-1865) illustrate the devastating effects of puerperal fever, a contagious disease that killed many woman after childbirth. Semmelweis collected data about the number of deaths from puerperal fever in both the First and Seconds Wards (see diagram).\n\n\nPhysicians, among them Semmelweis, were completely in the dark about the cause of puerperal fever.\nSemmelweis’ diary again:\n\n‘December 1846. Why do so many women die from this fever after giving birth without any problems? For centuries science has told us that it is an invisible epidemic that kills mothers. Causes may be changes in the air or some extraterrestrial influence or a movement of the earth itself, an earthquake.’\n\nNowadays not many people would consider extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake as possible causes of fever. We now know it has to do with hygienic conditions. But in the time Semmelweis lived, many people, even scientists, did! However, Semmelweis knew that it was unlikely that fever could be caused by extraterrestrial influence or an earthquake. He pointed at the data he collected (see diagram) and used this to try to persuade his colleagues.\n\n# Semmelweis’ Diary Text 2\n\nPart of the research in the hospital was dissection. The body of a deceased person was cut open to find a cause of death. Semmelweis recorded that the students working on the First ward usually took part in dissections on women who died the previous day, before they examined women who had just given birth. They did not pay much attention to cleaning themselves after the dissections. Some were even proud of the fact that you could tell by their smell that they had been working in the mortuary, as this showed how industrious they were! One of Semmelweis’ friends died after having cut himself during such a dissection. Dissection of his body showed he had the same symptoms as mothers who died from puerperal fever.

Second aspect: the splitting (of oxygen molecules) takes place under the influence of sunlight (picture 1). - The sun’s influence should be related to the splitting of O2 (an oxygen molecule or oxygen molecules). - If the sun’s influence is related to the forming of an ozone molecule from an oxygen atom and an oxygen molecule (pictures 2 and 3) no credit should be given for this second aspect. Note: Aspects 1 and 2 may typically be given in the one sentence. Third aspect: the oxygen atoms combine with other oxygen molecules to form ozone molecules (pictures 2 and 3). - Credit (one point) should be given for this aspect if the answer contains any description of an O combining with an O2. If the formation of O3 is described as the combining of (three, separate) O atoms, credit should not be given for this third aspect. - If O3 is not described as a molecule or molecules but for example as “a group of atoms” this can be tolerated for the third aspect. Examples of such answers: - When the sun shines on the O2 molecule the two atoms separate. The two O atoms look for other O2 molecules to join with. When the O1 and O2 join they form O3, which is ozone. - The strip illustrates the formation of ozone. If an oxygen molecule is affected by the sun, it breaks into two separate atoms. These separate atoms, O, float around looking for a molecule to link up to; they link up to existing O2 molecules and form an O3 molecule, as three atoms are now joined together; O3 forms ozone. - The little guys are O, or oxygen atoms. When two are joined they make O2 or oxygen molecules. The sun causes these to decompose into oxygen again. The O2 atoms then bond with O2 molecules creating O3, which is ozone . [Note: this answer can be regarded as correct. There is only one slip of the pen (“O2 atoms” after having mentioned “oxygen atoms” previously).]  ", "partial_credit": "-Answers which correctly mention only the first and second aspects. For example: - The sun decomposes the oxygen molecules into single atoms. The atoms fuse into groups. The atoms form groups of 3 atoms together. -Answers which correctly mention only the first and third aspects. For example: - Each of the little fellows stand for one atom of oxygen. O is one oxygen atom, O2 is an oxygen molecule and O3 is a group of atoms all joined together. The processes shown are one pair of oxygen atoms (O2) getting split and then each joining with 2 other pairs forming two groups of 3 (O3). - The little fellows are oxygen atoms. O2 means one oxygen molecule (like a pair of little fellows holding hands) and O3 means three oxygen atoms. The two oxygen atoms of one pair break apart and one joins each of the other pairs and out of the three pairs, two sets of three oxygen molecules (O3) are formed. -Answers which correctly mention only the second and third aspects. For example: - The oxygen is broken up by the sun’s radiation. It splits in half. The two sides go and join other oxygen “particles” forming ozone. - Most of the time in pure oxygen (O2) environments oxygen comes in pairs of 2 so there are 3 pairs of 2. 1 pair is getting too hot and they fly apart going into another pair making O3 instead of O2. [Note: Although “one pair is getting too hot” is not a very good description for the sun’s influence, credit should be given for the second aspect; the third aspect can also be regarded as correct.] -Answers which correctly mention the first aspect only. For example: - Oxygen molecules are breaking down. They form O atoms. And sometimes there are ozone molecules. The ozone layer remains the same because new molecules are formed and others die. -Answers which correctly mention only the second aspect. For example: - O represents an oxygen molecule, O2 = oxygen, O3 = ozone. Sometimes both oxygen molecules, joining each other, are separated by the sun. The single molecules join another pair and form ozone (O3).

[Note: the underlined part of the answer shows the third aspect. No credit can be given for the second aspect, because the sun is not involved in the formation of ozone from O + O2 but only in breaking down bonds in O2.] Answers which do not correctly mention any of the three aspects. For example: - The sun (ultraviolet rays) burns the ozone layer and at the same time is destroying it as well. Those little men are the ozone layers and they run away from the sun because it is so hot. [Note: no point can be awarded, not even for mentioning something about the sun’s influence.] - The sun is burning the ozone in the first box. In the second box they are running away with tears in their eyes and in the third box they are cuddling each other with tears in their eyes. - Well uncle Herb it’s simple. ‘O’ is one oxygen particle, the numbers next to ‘O’ increase the amounts of particles in the group."}, "is_translation": false}, "metadata": {"OECD Percentage Correct": 28, "is_attitude": "No", "n_visuals": 1, "n_tables": 0, "n_inputfields": 0, "ends_on_table": "No", "context_n_visuals": 0, "context_n_tables": 0, "context_is_empty": "No", "answer_is_table": "No", "answering_requires_nontext_modality": "No", "asks_for_explanation": "No", "is_multiple_choice": "No", "Item ID in MS Analysis Output": "S253Q01", "Thresholds (RP=.62)": 682, "Thresholds (Full Credit)": null}}
